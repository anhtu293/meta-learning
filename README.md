# Meta Learning

In this repo, meta learning's algorithms have been implemented and evaluated on Omniglot benchmark. Some algorithms have been implemented based on course CS330: Multi-task learning and Meta learning of Standford University. Some others have been implemented from others states of the arts in this fields. 

All algorithms have been implemented in Tensorflow 2.4.0.

## Algorithms
- MANN 
- MAML family (on going)
